Welcome to tomjuggler's software showcase

I am a circus performer who uses electronics and programming to enhance my performance. 


```
boolean isLinux = true;

void setup(){
	if(isLinux){
	  doTheJob(); 
	}
	else{
//	  
	}
}
```

Here I will showcase all my (open source) Circus Scientist related projects. 

Some of my favorite code examples: 

1. [Arduino EEProm](https://github.com/tomjuggler/EepromOnOffLedExample)

Here I show how to use the EEProm with Arduino to save states between boots. 
This method usually finds it's way into my projects in one form or another. 

2. [Generating Arduino code from Processing](https://github.com/tomjuggler/ArduinoCodeGeneratorBlinkExample)

The concept here is simple: get a Processing sketch to write your Arduino code for you. 
Here I provide a simple example to get the blink sketch generated, with a variable that the user can change.
