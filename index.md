Welcome to tomjuggler's software showcase

I am a circus performer who uses electronics and programming to enhance my performance. 


```
boolean isLinux = true;

void setup(){
	if(isLinux){
	  doTheJob(); 
	}
	else{
//	  
	}
}
```

Here I will showcase all my (open source) Circus Scientist related projects.
